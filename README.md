# IronmanScraper
Web scraping notebook &amp; script for extracting Ironman Dataset.

# Overview
The following files were used to scrape 140.6 Ironman race results. Note, that the data was not scraped from the official Ironman website, but a [proxy-website](https://www.coachcox.co.uk/imstats/) not owned by Ironman. The notebook and scripts were designed in a way that generated 3 CSVs that follow the format of a standard relational database and can be joined together utilizing various IDs.

The resulting data can be found on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/miguswong/ironman-140-6-results-dataset-2002-2024/data) and open for public use.

Further discussions of the methodology and overall scraping process can be found on my [personal website](https://miguswong.github.io/).
